# Video game translation layer
A tool for applying fan translations over video games using image analysis. This is an crude alternative to modding the game itself.

Proof of concept is done in Lua and ran using LÃ–VE 0.10.1.

The program searches screenshots for known images and then draws translated graphic over them.
